","body":"# Joseph Burtoft's Portfolio Page\r\n\r\n\r\n## About Me\r\nI am a 24 year-old software developer from Indiana. I graduated from Purdue University in 2012 and  [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) in 2013. During my time at Dev Bootcamp I especially enjoyed working with Javascript and persisting data to and from the DOM. I'm currently based in Chicago volunteering as a TA at Dev Bootcamp and working on a turn based web game. \r\n\r\n##Relevant Skills\r\n* Ruby\r\n* Javascript\r\n* Rails\r\n* Sinatra\r\n* Rspec\r\n* Jquery\r\n* SQL\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n### [City Pulse](http://limitless-temple-4888.herokuapp.com/)\r\nCity Pulse is a project I started with a team of guys at Dev Bootcamp as our capstone. The site was designed to give the user a digital visualization of the city of Chicago. We used six APIs that supplied us with geolocated data that we could plot using google maps. This project incorporates web sockets for persisting data from the server to the client in a free flow without a trigger. the site also incorporates the use of cron tasks that fetch fresh data from apis to be held and then displayed to our users. we chose to retrieve our data via cron rather than on a user action to reduce the rate of API calls from the current amount of users to a constant 15 a minute. \r\n#####[Repo](https://github.com/ztnark/chicageaux)\r\n\r\n#### Fun Buzz words \r\n1.

This was our first rails application and gave us a chance to learn rail's server actions and routing. This project was developed to gamify the mentor process here at DBC. The app uses an oauth system and an API set up by former students that verifies a user as a DBC student and correlates them with their data pulled from the DBC API. The app gives students the ability to give points to fellow students for their help and resources. This was the first project that we were able to work with Rspec and develop controller tests and integration tests.  \r\n#####[Repo](https://github.com/jojo89/dbc_power)\r\n\r\n#### Fun Buzz words \r\n1.
